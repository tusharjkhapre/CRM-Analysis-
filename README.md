## Data Modeling with Excel

Excel was used to model CRM data for:
- **Quick Data Summarization**: Pivot tables were used to summarize large datasets quickly, allowing for easy trend spotting.
- **Data Comparisons**: Data was broken down by business type, lead source, and opportunity status for easy comparisons.
- **Data Exploration**: Interactive exploration of data without altering the raw dataset, allowing for flexible analysis.

## Data Validation and SQL Usage

- **Data Transformation and Cleansing**: SQL was used to transform raw CRM data into a format suitable for analysis. This included merging data from multiple sources and creating calculated fields.
- **Data Integrity**: SQL joins were designed to ensure accuracy, consistency, and security in data retrieval. This process involved implementing validation rules to maintain precise and reliable data.

## Visualization with Power BI

Power BI was utilized to visualize the CRM data, providing key insights:
- **Total Leads by Country**: North America had the majority of leads, while Africa, Asia, and South America were under-penetrated regions.
- **Lead Type by Industry**: Life Sciences and Safety & Security were the leading industries in terms of leads, while Banking and Hospitality had lower engagement.
- **Lead Source by Lead Type**: Most leads came from new opportunities (81.79%), indicating a strong inflow of fresh leads.

## Visualization with Tableau

Tableau was used to visualize trends over time:
- **Running Total of Active Opportunities**: Active opportunities increased significantly from 2018 to 2020 but plateaued afterward.
- **Closed Won vs Total Closed**: Steady growth from 2016 to 2020 in closed-won deals, followed by a sharp decline after 2020.
- **Running Total vs. Forecast**: Forecasted opportunities peaked in 2021, with stable expectations from 2021 to 2023.

## Key Insights

- **Growth Plateau**: Post-2020, opportunity growth plateaued, suggesting market saturation or a shift in business conditions.
- **Regional Insights**: North America dominates lead generation, while Africa, Asia, and South America are under-exploited markets.
- **Lead Utilization**: New leads are abundant, but potential customers are underutilized, presenting an opportunity to improve conversion strategies.
- **Industry Focus**: Biopharmaceuticals and Safety & Security sectors are leaders in opportunity generation.

## Strategic Recommendations

- **Expand into Untapped Markets**: Focus efforts on under-represented regions like Africa, Asia, and South America to capture new leads.
- **Improve Lead Conversion**: Develop more effective strategies to convert potential customers into sales.
- **Diversify Focus**: Broaden CRM strategies beyond high-value areas to mitigate risk and capture more market share.
- **Revise Sales Strategies**: Adjust sales strategies to counter the post-2020 decline in closed-won opportunities.

## Conclusion

CRM analytics is a critical tool for improving decision-making, customer satisfaction, and business growth. This analysis provides insights into how businesses can optimize sales processes, capture new opportunities, and respond to market changes. Moving forward, integrating advanced technologies like artificial intelligence and machine learning into CRM systems can further enhance predictive capabilities and drive continuous innovation.
